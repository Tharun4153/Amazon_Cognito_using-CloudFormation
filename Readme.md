### AWS Cognito Integration Guide

#### Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to what AWS Cognito is and why it's useful for your application. Explain that AWS Cognito can help you handle user authentication and access control seamlessly.

#### Prerequisites
List any prerequisites that users need to have before they can integrate AWS Cognito into their application. This might include an AWS account, basic familiarity with AWS services, and the necessary permissions.

#### Steps to Integrate AWS Cognito
1. **Create a User Pool**: Explain how to create an AWS Cognito User Pool, which represents the user directory for your application. Provide screenshots or code snippets showing how to configure important settings like user attributes, policies, and sign-up/sign-in options.

2. **Configure App Clients**: Describe the process of creating and configuring app clients within your User Pool. Highlight the client settings that control user authentication, such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect settings.

3. **Integrate Authentication in your Application**: Provide code snippets or guidelines for integrating AWS Cognito authentication into your application. This could include using SDKs or libraries to handle user registration, sign-in, and token management.

4. **Customize UI and User Flows**: Explain how to customize the user interface and user flows of your application to match your branding and user experience. This could involve using AWS Cognito's built-in customization options or building your own UI components.

5. **Access Control and Authorization**: Discuss how to use AWS Cognito to control user access to different parts of your application. Describe concepts like groups, roles, and policies that help you manage user permissions.

6. **Advanced Features (Optional)**: If your application requires more advanced features, you could briefly touch on topics like multi-factor authentication (MFA), social identity providers, and integration with other AWS services.

## Overview

This project aims to provide user authentication functionality using AWS Cognito and a custom domain called "ivaans." The authentication system is integrated into a set of HTML pages, including `index.html`, `login.html`, and `logout.html`, to enhance the security and user experience of your web application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Utilize AWS Cognito's hosted UI to manage user authentication securely.
- **Custom Domain**: Set up a custom domain, "ivaans," for a more personalized user experience.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the authentication system and integrate it into your project:

1. **AWS Cognito Configuration**:
   - Create an AWS Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool.
   - Customize the hosted UI by configuring the call by URL and signout URLs to match your project's requirements.

2. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - Configure a custom domain named "ivaans" to provide a branded authentication experience.
   - Update the necessary DNS records to map your custom domain to the AWS Cognito hosted UI.

3. **HTML Pages Integration**:
   - Place the provided `index.html`, `login.html`, and `logout.html` pages in your project directory.
   - Update the Cognito configuration details (e.g., user pool ID, client ID) within the HTML pages.

## Usage

1. **Registration and Login**:
   - Users can access the login page (`login.html`) to sign in or register for an account.
   - The hosted UI will handle the authentication process securely.

2. **Authenticated Pages**:
   - Once authenticated, users will be able to access protected parts of your web application.
   - Integrate Cognito's authentication checks into your application logic to ensure secure access.

3. **Logout**:
   - Users can log out by visiting the `logout.html` page, which will invalidate their session.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the AWS Cognito documentation for troubleshooting and further assistance.
